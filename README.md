# 🎭 EmoFusion — Multimodal Emotion Recognition System

**Text + Audio  Emotion Recognition with Fusion & Real-Time Prediction**

---

# 📌 Overview

EmoFusion is an end-to-end multimodal emotion recognition system integrating:

- 📝 Text
- 🎤 Audio
- 🎥 Video

The system supports:

- Dataset cleaning
- Modality-specific preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Deep learning model training
- Early & Late fusion strategies
- Feature optimization
- Evaluation
- Real-time prediction (Text + Audio)

First it is preprocessed and trained on classic models then optimised features and applied deep models like state of art methods 
then fusion is appied on the trained models and then emotion is predicted in realtime (text+audio) with confidence scores.
The challenge am facing in this is video feature extraction and integrating it. This is also my one of the future scope.
Realtime deployment can also be later integrated into this and availble for future use.
