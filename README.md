WELCOME TO MY EMOFUSION PROJECT..

INTRODUCTION
EMOFUSION...
This work deals with analyzing different modalities (such as speech, facial expressions, and text) that interact with each other to detect emotions. 
The extracted features from each modality are then fused together, and the combined representation is tested to obtain more accurate emotion recognition.
